This is our implementation of algorithm 4.11 from the paper 'Selection Conditions in main memory'

Commands:
1. Run the make file with 'make'. To clear the files, run 'make clean'
2. Execute program as './stage2.sh query.txt config.txt'

File Description:
1. Main.java - this is the main file where the algorithm is implemented.
2. Element.java - This holds the representation of an array element object used by the algorith,
3. Bitmap.java - holds the Bitmap class that contains the bitmap representation of a set.
4. config.txt - stores the configuration values as specified in the paper
5. query.txt - contains the selectivity values that are used as input to the algorithm. Each line corresponds to one set of inputs.
